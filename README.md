Hi I'm Gnod Do. 
In this lab I used React on the front-end and Spring Boot on the back-end.
A few other technologies have been used such as: Redux, JPA, JWT,...
To install and run the program on your personal computer, you need to follow these steps:
1. Clone project
2. Configure back-end in file application.properties
3. Install React dependencies (go into the studentfrontend folder then in the terminal type the command "npm install")
4. Check to see if the React side encounters any config? If so, it may be because the versions of the packages are out of date.
5. Once you have everything set up, make sure you have a Tomcat server or something similar
6. Finally run the program and drink a cold beer. As for me, I need to go to sleep.
